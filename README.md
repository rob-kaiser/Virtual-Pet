## The Llama

 I created a public VirtualPet class and a VirtualPetApp main class.
The public class contains the instance variables.
- hunger
- sleep
- sick
- stillAlive

 They are used within the methods to be called upon from the main class.
 
 I used the website [Text-Image](http://www.text-image.com/) to create the ascii image of the llamas.
 
 The VirtualPetApp class asks the user for the llamas name and then prompts them to make a selection. The user can select...
 
 - Feed
 - Play a game
 - Go for a walk
 - View Your levels
 
 Although the levels can be viewed at anytime, it is never explained what they are or that the llama will die no matter what. It is impossible to stay alive because as soon as the player makes the users 4th selection the llama's sick level is equal to death. The tick() method is attributed to the decline of the health of that poor llama.
